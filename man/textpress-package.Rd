\title{textpress: A Lightweight and Versatile NLP Toolkit}
\description{
A lightweight toolkit for text retrieval and NLP with a consistent and
predictable API organized around four actions: fetching, reading, processing,
and searching. Functions cover the full pipeline from web data acquisition to
text processing and indexing. Multiple search strategies are supported
including regex, BM25 keyword ranking, cosine similarity, and dictionary
matching. Pipe-friendly with no heavy dependencies and all outputs are plain
data frames. Also useful as a building block for retrieval-augmented
generation pipelines and autonomous agent workflows.
