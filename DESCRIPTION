Description: A lightweight toolkit for text retrieval and NLP with a consistent and
    predictable API organized around four actions: fetching, reading,
    processing, and searching. Functions cover the full pipeline from web
    data acquisition to text processing and indexing. Multiple search
    strategies are supported including regex, BM25 keyword ranking, cosine
    similarity, and dictionary matching. Pipe-friendly with no heavy
    dependencies and all outputs are plain data frames. Also useful as a
    building block for retrieval-augmented generation pipelines and
    autonomous agent workflows.
